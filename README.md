# Unix-Shell
Custom Unix shell

This is meant to be an extended project of creating my own Unix shell. I have only included necessary features at this time (11/13/22). The purpose of
this project is mainly to practice forking, parsing, and using Unix in general. 

To do:
- Backgrounding
- Input file redirection
- Output file redirection
- Piping between programs 
- Custom object for built-in commands
  - More built-ins
